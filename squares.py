# The following example builds the same list of square numbers you saw earlier but uses a list comprehension:
squares = [value**2 for value in range(1,11)]
print(squares)

# When youâ€™re writing three or four lines of code to generate lists and it begins to feel repetitive, consider writing your own list comprehensions.
